# Deepfake Image Classification
A multi-class image classification project focused on detecting and classifying deepfake images generated by generative models. The task involves distinguishing between five categories of synthetically created images using machine learning models, primarily a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset is divided into three subsets:

|Subset	    | Size	  | Description               |
|-----------|---------|---------------------------|
|train	    | 12,500	| Labeled training images   |
|validation	| 1,250	  | Labeled validation images |
|test       |	6,500	  | Unlabeled test images     |

Each image is resized to 100x100 pixels and normalized to the range [0, 1].

## Models
## 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Implemented using scikit-learn

Used Manhattan distance with k = 11 performing best

### Achieved:

~38% accuracy using pixel values

~59% accuracy using HSV color histograms only

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Implemented in TensorFlow

Dual-input model:

- Image Input: RGB image (100x100x3)

- Histogram Input: 48-d HSV histogram (16 bins/channel)

Model Components:

- 5 Convolutional Blocks (Conv2D ‚Üí BatchNorm ‚Üí LeakyReLU ‚Üí MaxPooling)

- Residual Connections between Conv Blocks

- Global Average Pooling

- Concatenation with histogram features

- Dense layers + Dropout (0.5)

- Final Softmax for 5-class classification

Optimization:

- AdamW optimizer

- SparseCategoricalCrossentropy loss

- ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler + EarlyStopping

## Performance
Best Validation Accuracy: 93.60%

Class 2 and 3 are the easiest to classify

Class 4 is frequently misclassified due to subtle cues

## Experiments & Tuning
- Histogram bin count: 16 performed best

- Dropout rates: 0.5 yielded better generalization than 0.3

- Global Average Pooling outperformed flattening

- ReduceLROnPlateau worked better than CosineDecay scheduling

## Preprocessing & Augmentation
- Images normalized and resized

- Offline augmentation applied to avoid training overhead and overfitting
